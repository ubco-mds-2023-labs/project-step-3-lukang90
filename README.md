### fruit_info.py

Module fruit_info defines a hierarchy of fruit classes (subclasses: Apple, Cherry, Peach) that represent various fruits planted in the orchard, and methods to store, modify and manage their information. 

#### Class: Fruit

Class Fruit represents an abstract base class for various fruits planted in an orchard. It includes basic information about fruit, such as fruit variety, size, sweet, sour, taste, price, use, etc
   - variety: The variety of the fruit.
   - size: The size of the fruit. e.g.: medium, big
   - sweet: The sweetness of the fruit e.g. very sweet
   - sour: The sourness of the fruit. e.g. less sour
   - taste: The taste of the fruit, e.g., 'crunchy'.
   - price: The price of the fruit. e.g. 2.99
   - use: The intended use of the fruit. e.g.: "pie"

Method of Fruit:
- `describe() -> string`: 
Returns a brief statement describing the fruit, including size, sourness, sweetness, taste, and use. 
- `get_price() -> float`: 
Returns the price of the fruit.
- `set_price(price)`: 
Sets the price of the fruit.

Abstract Methods in Fruit: 
- `get_type_num() -> int`: 
Abstract method, returns the type number of the fruit.
- `get_available_season(date)`: 
Abstract method, returns the available season of the fruit for the given date.
- `get_type()`: 
Abstract method, returns the type of fruit.

Those three abstract methods will be concretely implemented in subclasses: Apple, Cherry and Peach


#### Subclasses of Fruit:

- Apple: 
Represents an Apple, a specific subclass of Fruit.
    - type_num: The unique type number assigned to all instances of Apple.
    - type: The type of fruit, always set to "apple".
    - season_dict: A dictionary correlating the seasons with the variety of apples allowed for cultivation in the orchard.

- Cherry:
Represents a Cherry, a specific subclass of Fruit.
    - type_num: The unique type number assigned to all instances of Cherry.
    - type: The type of fruit, always set to "cherry".
    - season_dict: A dictionary correlating the seasons with the variety of cherries allowed for cultivation in the orchard.

- Peach:
Represents a Peach, a specific subclass of Fruit.
    - type_num (int): The unique type number assigned to all instances of Peach. always set to 1
    - type (str): The type of fruit, always set to "peach".
    - season_dict (dict): A dictionary correlating the seasons with the variety of peaches
      allowed for cultivation in the orchard.

Methods in subclasses:
- `get_type_num() -> int`: 
Returns the type number of apple/cherry/peach.

### plantation.py

Module plantations contains class and functions related to fruit cultivation regioins. The whole plantation is divided into several regions for different fruit and different use (customer picking/market wholesale.) There is a class region record the basic information and status of regions. Methods including area calculations, region summary report, and data storeage using Dataframes, etc. 

#### Class: Region

## Management Subpackage

### inventory.py

Handles inventory, remaining production capacity management and simple visualization.

#### Datafiles:
Here are three CSV files: "inventory.csv", "remaining_productivity.csv", and "extra_productivity.csv".   

  - **inventory.csv** : 
  Store the inventory situation, with the latest stock data located at the bottom of the csv table, including historical stock data. 
  - **remaining_productivity.csv** ï¼š 
  Store the estimated remaining productivity. Estimates the yield based on different types of fruits and the corresponding planting areas in orchards first. The estimated yield will be updated as fruits harvested and added to the inventory, or are directly picked and purchased by customers. In case of natural disasters or other events causing a decrease in productivity, adjustments can be made independently.

## Main
Module main.py in the package orchardmanagement is the control panel of the orchard management app. It is combined by fruit_info_operation.py, plantation_operation.py, inventory_operation.py and sales_operation.py
 It provides functionality to view and manage fruit categories, production regions, production inventory, and business orders.

Functions in main.py:
- `basic_choice_select(fruit_file, plantation_file)`: 
Allows the user to make choices to manage the orchard. This is the entry point for orchard employees to access the database. In this context, employees can connect to the database, retrieve information, and perform various tasks related to orchard management.

Imports a file using a relative path to create an absolute path
- `fruit_init`: 
Initializes the fruit information for the orchard.
- `plantation_init`:
